I made this website during my 2 months internship for 3A Development, a french start-up.

## Stand 3D üåç
Stand3D is a company specialized in communication for more than 20 years. Specializing in the exhibition stand, I had to make the Stand3D website more accessible. Most of my work was to modernize the website while keeping the expertise of its own.

## Description üîé
From July to September 2018, I held the position of <b>UI - UX designer</b> within the company 3A Development. This learning has been an opportunity for me to become aware of my affinities with the areas of <b>creativity</b> and <b>development</b>. Started as an interface designer, my internship ended as a front-end and back-end developer. The challenge was to show equal skills in these two distinct environments. Now more qualified, I completely imagine myself evolving in the field of the web.
